Item-Similarity-Viz
===================

This is a Visualization using D3, JQuery and other JS libraries.

A Visualization can be pretty simple but at the same time very powerful.
This is one such example I am putting forward.

Data set is taken from Amazon site, looking for items bought together. So when a user is trying to buy a product, he can use this visualization on a side bar, which shows them what other users bought with the product. This makes a split second for user to look at similar stuff and add to cart.
